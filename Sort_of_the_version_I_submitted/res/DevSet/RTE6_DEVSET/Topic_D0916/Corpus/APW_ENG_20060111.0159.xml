Memorial set for Jamestown native believed to have been killed in Iraq

<S s_id="1">
The family of an electrical contractor believed killed by a militant group in Iraq is convinced he is dead, and is preparing a memorial service.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
The Islamic Army of Iraq claimed that it killed Ronald Schulz last month, and a video on a Web site, purportedly posted by the group, showed a blindfolded man being shot in the back of the head.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
His face was not shown and it was impossible to verify his identity.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
The video also showed Schulz's identity card.

While U.S. officials have not confirmed Shulz's death, his sister, Julie Schulz, said Tuesday night that the family identified him from two videos reportedly posted by the group.

"Although his face was not visible, there are enough consistencies between the two videos and enough evidence that my family, in our hearts, believe that Ron is dead," Schulz said.

"We had hoped his body would be found so that we could bring him home.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
But this has not happened."

The family is planning a memorial service on Jan. 14.

Shulz, 40, was working as an electrical contractor when he was kidnapped.

<S s_id="11">
Insurgents have kidnapped more than 250 foreigners in the past two years, aiming to force U.S.-led troops to leave Iraq or prevent Arab nations from strengthening their ties with the Baghdad government.

<S s_id="12">
Most recently, Jill Carroll, an American freelance reporter, was kidnapped in Baghdad shortly after she was leading office of a leading Sunni politician.

No claim of responsibility has so far been issued in Carroll's case.
