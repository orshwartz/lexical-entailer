FOUNDATION MAY KEEP TRADE CENTER MEMORIAL BUSINESS OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Don't look now -- actually, you can't look now -- but a great deal of decision-making about the public realm at the new World Trade Center may disappear from public view behind closed boardroom doors.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation board met Wednesday for the first time before emerging for an introduction to the site by the architects Daniel Libeskind and Michael Arad.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
Because the board includes Robert De Niro and Barbara Walters, there were many cameras and microphones to capture that moment in the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, overlooking ground zero.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
Images and sound bites convey a false sense of accessibility, however.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
The truth is that the two-hour meeting was closed to the public and the news media, since the foundation is a private corporation.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Officials have long complimented themselves -- sometimes with good reason -- on the openness and transparency of planning efforts at the trade center site.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
But the future may hold opacity, or at least translucence, as the nonprofit foundation assumes more of the role that the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. has performed until now.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
The impact of this shift has not received much attention, perhaps because the very name "Foundation" understates the new body's role and potential clout.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
On the face of it, it sounds like a genteel, cup-in-hand group that will solicit charitable contributions that the development corporation, a state agency, cannot.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
Indeed, the foundation will be a fund-raising organization.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
"All levels of gifts -- from $1 to $100 million -- will be sought and accepted," said its September 2003 application for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)3 of the internal revenue code.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
(With about $3.5 million now in hand, $496.5 million is still to be raised.)
</S>
<S s_id="13">
But the foundation was given a broader range of powers in its April 2003 certificate of incorporation, beginning with its purpose: "To own, construct, operate and maintain a memorial and related structures and appurtenances on the site of the World Trade Center."
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Own.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Construct.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Operate.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Maintain.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
That is a lot of responsibility, with many implications for the way the public will experience the memorial, the interpretive memorial center and the museums and the theaters, since the foundation is also charged with "encouraging the development of cultural facilities as part of the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site."
</S>
<S s_id="19">
The foundation has a lot of power to do these jobs.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
It may "solicit, accept, hold, invest, reinvest and administer any gifts, bequests, devises, benefits of trusts and property of any sort, without limitation as to amount or value, and to use, disburse or donate the principal or income."
</S>
<S s_id="21">
(A devise is a gift of real property by will.)
</S>
<S s_id="22">
It may also "purchase, lease, receive, own, sell and convey real and personal property of all kinds."
</S>
<S s_id="23">
But it does not have to let the public listen in.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
"There is no law that requires that the board must be open," said Ira M. Millstein, a senior partner in the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, who is counsel to the development corporation board and one of the foundation's directors.
</S>
<S s_id="25">
The board could choose to operate more openly.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
"This is a decision for the board to make," Millstein said.
</S>
<S s_id="27">
"It's very difficult to have a hair-down discussion with everyone watching.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
On the other hand, we want to be completely transparent."
</S>
<S s_id="29">
Wednesday's session was largely procedural, according to those who were there.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
Deputy Mayor Patricia E. Harris became the 33rd director and Jason R. Lilien was named counsel.
</S>
<S s_id="31">
Walters, the one reporter in the room, raised the issue of openness.
</S>
<S s_id="32">
John C. Whitehead, the interim chairman, told board members that meeting minutes would be made public.
</S>
<S s_id="33">
The Lower Manhattan Development Corp. maintains a virtual library of important planning documents on its Web site, www.renewnyc.com, and opens its monthly board meetings to the public and the press.
</S>
<S s_id="34">
True, almost all the substantive work goes on behind the scenes.
</S>
<S s_id="35">
But several useful civic purposes are served.
</S>
<S s_id="36">
For one, the principals almost always attend.
</S>
<S s_id="37">
This means that citizens who show up to register their unhappiness with the corporation -- particularly for its failure to finance more job-creation and lower-income housing programs -- may be assured at least that their placards, banners and lapel buttons are being read by the people in charge.
</S>
<S s_id="38">
One can argue whether these quiet protests have any meaningful effect but the board can never adjourn under the impression that its policies are uniformly popular.
</S>
<S s_id="39">
Last month, for instance, members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York showed up to criticize the corporation for not helping finance a restaurant planned downtown to employ displaced workers from Windows on the World.
</S>
<S s_id="40">
The matter was not even on the agenda but the workers had a chance to make their grievance felt.
</S>
<S s_id="41">
Reporters are given about 10 minutes after each meeting to ask questions of anyone on the board, particularly those who would otherwise be hard to reach.
</S>
<S s_id="42">
The principals typically stay for this question-and-answer session, even though they are sometimes put on the spot.
</S>
<S s_id="43">
Meetings can be revealing.
</S>
<S s_id="44">
Though they are tightly organized, with little freewheeling discussion, it is possible to see fissures within the board by paying attention to the questions, objections and exceptions that members register, even as they vote -- generally unanimously -- to adopt the items before them.
</S>
<S s_id="45">
Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the development corporation and a foundation director, said, "The board clearly understands the public trust which they have undertaken and are committed to the same level of transparency as the LMDC."
