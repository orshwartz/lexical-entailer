Nominee for Attorney General promises to abide by treaties on torture if confirmed attorney general
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Attorney General nominee Alberto Gonzales is promising senators that he will abide by treaties prohibiting the torture of prisoners, despite deriding the restraints as relics in 2002.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
White House counsel Gonzales, in line to become the first Hispanic attorney general, had a hand in much of the White House's post-Sept. 11 terrorism policies as President George W. Bush's top lawyer.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
His confirmation hearing Thursday offered Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee a fresh chance to criticize Gonzales and the advice he gave Bush.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
Among the most contentious matters is a memo Gonzales wrote in January 2002 in which he argued that the fight against terrorism "renders obsolete" the Geneva Conventions' prohibitions against torture.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
A month later, Bush signed an order declaring he had the authority to bypass the accords "in this or future conflicts."
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Bush's order also said the Geneva treaty's references to prisoners of war did not apply to al-Qaida or "unlawful combatants" from the Taliban.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
Some of Gonzales' critics say that decision and his memo lead to the torture scandal at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison and abuses of detainees in U.S. custody in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
In testimony prepared for his hearing, Gonzales said Bush has made clear that the government will defend Americans from terrorists "in a manner consistent with our nation's values and applicable law, including our treaty obligations."
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Gonzales added, "I pledge that, if I am confirmed as attorney general, I will abide by those commitments," according to the testimony obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
Last June, the Justice Department withdrew its 2002 memos arguing that the president's wartime authority supersedes laws and treaties governing treatment of prisoners.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
On Wednesday, former Justice Department officials sought to distance the White House from its legal conclusions.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
John Yoo, who helped write the memos while at the department's Office of Legal Counsel, said that while Gonzales was briefed on drafts, he and other officials did not attempt to influence the content.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
"The idea that the Office of Legal Counsel was providing advice that was dictated, demanded or influenced by the White House, that's just flatly untrue," said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Gonzales has repudiated torture before.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
"The president has stated that this administration does not condone torture.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
If anyone engages in such conduct, he or she will be held accountable," Gonzales said in a White House online event on July 7.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Democrats, not satisfied with just those statements, planned to question Gonzales extensively.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
"It is clear he was in the chain receiving this critical documentation relative to changing American standards on the treatment of prisoners, so he was not a bystander, he was part of it," said Sen. Richard Durbin.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Bush firmly backs Gonzales' nomination.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
"Judge Gonzales is a very trusted adviser to the president (and is) doing an outstanding job," McClellan told reporters traveling Wednesday with the president aboard Air Force One.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
Democrats are expecting Gonzales to be confirmed by the Republican-majority Senate.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
"I have found him someone I could work with when he wasn't simply pursuing an agenda that was thrust upon him," said Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
Freshman Sen. Ken Salazar of Colorado, who is Hispanic, was expected to join Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, in introducing Gonzales at the hearing.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
Civil rights and humanitarian groups have portrayed Gonzales as the person responsible for abuses by Americans against terrorism suspects held as prisoners.
</S>
<S s_id="25">
"Mr. Gonzales bears much of the responsibility for creating the legal framework and permissive atmosphere that led to the torture and abuse at Guantanamo and elsewhere," said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
Gonzales' memo from Jan. 25, 2002, argued that the terrorism fight "renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions."
</S>
<S s_id="27">
In his prepared Senate testimony, Gonzales was repeating the contention that terrorists are not soldiers and thus are not covered by the conventions.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
Nonetheless, according to his testimony, "We must be committed to preserving civil rights and civil liberties."
</S>
<S s_id="29">
Democrats wanted to ask Gonzales about other terrorism issues, including the government's detention of Jose Padilla, a U.S. citizen who the government alleges was part of an al-Qaida plot to set off a radiological bomb.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
Arrested after the 2001 attacks, Padilla later was designated an enemy combatant, brought to the brig in South Carolina and prevented from challenging his detention.
</S>
<S s_id="31">
He has sued over his detention.
</S>
<S s_id="32">
Some Republicans say Democrats are just setting up arguments to use against Gonzales in case Bush decides to elevate him to the Supreme Court, should a vacancy occur.
