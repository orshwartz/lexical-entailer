Jury selection starts for retrial of former Tyco executives accused of looting company of $600 million
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Jury selection began Tuesday for the second trial of two former top Tyco International Ltd. executives charged with looting the company of $600 million (euro459 million) to subsidize their lavish lifestyles.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Prosecutors promised to present a leaner case this time against former Tyco chairman and CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark Swartz.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
In the first trial, prosecutors played a videotape of the $2 million (euro1.53 million) birthday party Kozlowski threw for his wife on a Mediterranean island, and a video tour through his $18 million (euro14 million) Fifth Avenue apartment.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
This time around, prosecutors were expected to focus less on items such as Kozlowski's $6,000 (euro4,600) gold-threaded shower curtain and more on how he and Swartz allegedly looted the company.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
The retrial is expected to last about four months.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Kozlowski, 58, and Swartz, 44, are charged with grand larceny, falsifying business records, conspiracy and business law violations.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
The defendants each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charges.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
Their first trial, which lasted six months, was aborted last year because of a menacing letter and telephone call to a juror.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Kozlowski and Swartz are accused of stealing $170 million (euro130 million) by hiding unauthorized bonuses and secretly forgiving loans to themselves, and pocketing $430 million (euro329 million) more by pumping up Tyco stock with lies about the state of the company's finances.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
Defense lawyers said Kozlowski and Swartz earned every penny they got from Tyco.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
The judge has already thrown out the top charge in the original indictment _ enterprise corruption.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
That count suggested that Kozlowski and Swartz had conspired with others to turn Tyco into a criminal enterprise.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Tyco, which has about 270,000 employees and $36 billion (euro27.6 billion) in annual revenue, makes a wide range of products including electronics, medical supplies and security devices.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
The company is based in Bermuda.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Its U.S. headquarters is in West Windsor, New Jersey.
