PAKISTANI SCIENTIST WAS CEO OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION NET
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Public enemy No. 1 for most Americans is Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks who continues to threaten more deadly strikes against the United States.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
In close competition for that dubious title should be Abdul Qadeer Khan, 68, also known as A.Q. Khan the Pakistani nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to U.S. adversaries, possibly including al-Qaida, bin Laden's terrorist group.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
Khan arguably has done more to undermine U.S. security than bin Laden.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
He has confessed to transferring nuclear weapons know-how to Iran, Libya and North Korea.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
U.S. officials and investigators at the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency are still searching for other possible customers who possess Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear-specific manufacturing equipment and how-to manuals for running uranium enrichment centrifuges, much of it on handy compact disks.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Since the invention of nuclear weapons 60 years ago, no one has done more to spread those weapons to more countries than Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
The Khan network of suppliers, middlemen and front companies flourished across 30 countries.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
He was a for-profit nuclear proliferator, with a one-stop atomic emporium that allowed shoppers to buy bomb designs, centrifuges for enriching uranium from uranium hexafluoride, and consulting services to help get weapons plants up and running.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
-- "At least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden" -- former CIA Director George Tenet.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
-- "A very serious proliferatorvery dangerous to the world" -- Secretary of State Colin Powell.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
-- Khan's nuclear smuggling network is "mind-boggling" and "beyond anyone's imagination" -- Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
-- "A monstrous creature" -- Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
-- Khan "has poured kerosene on the nuclear proliferation embers." -- Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, D.C.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
-- "He did huge damage" to U.S. security -- Graham Allison, former assistant secretary of defense and author of "Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe."
</S>
<S s_id="15">
-- Khan is "an evil genius, a Dr. Strangelove" -- Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Despite his notoriety, A. Q. Khan has escaped the "most-wanted" label applied to bin Laden because of a delicate diplomatic and political minuet linking Khan, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and President Bush.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Each man for his own reasons has thrown a cloak of silence over what is emerging as the biggest nuclear scandal in history.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
In contrast to the missing bin Laden -- target of a global manhunt -- Khan's whereabouts are well known.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
He is living under house arrest in a tony section of Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, as part of a deal that Musharraf unveiled last year.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
That deal gave Khan a full pardon and allowed him to keep the millions of dollars he is believed to have netted from the illicit sales.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
In exchange, Khan took responsibility for the crimes and agreed to the house arrest -- a punishment that forced Khan, a high profile and beloved figure in Pakistan, to vanish from public life and scientific endeavor.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
A U.S. alert to Musharraf apparently triggered Khan's confession.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
According to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the United States by early 2004 had amassed so much evidence that Khan was peddling nuclear secrets that Powell telephoned Musharraf and told him to "deal with" Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
"I said to him, "We know so much about this that we're going to go public with it, and within a few weeks, okay?
</S>
<S s_id="25">
And you need to deal with this before you have to deal with it publicly."'
</S>
<S s_id="26">
The next step came on Feb. 4 when, in a dramatic televised speech, Khan confessed and -- without naming the countries that had received his services -- accepted "full responsibility" for exporting nuclear technology.
</S>
<S s_id="27">
"My dear brothers and sisters, I have chosen to appear before you to offer my deepest regrets and unqualified apologies," he said, speaking in English.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
The nuclear proliferation, he said, was "initiated at my behest."
</S>
<S s_id="29">
"I was confronted with the evidence and the findings, and I have voluntarily admitted that much of it is true and accurate," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
He was quick to absolve the Musharraf government of any involvement.
</S>
<S s_id="31">
While some of his colleagues at the A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories -- Pakistan's top nuclear facility -- are also under investigation for trafficking, "There was never any kind of authorization for these activities by the government," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="32">
The next day, it was Musharraf's turn to appear before the TV cameras.
</S>
<S s_id="33">
Dressed in an Army jacket, khaki trousers and combat boots, the Pakistani leader announced at a news conference that he had pardoned Khan for spreading the potential for nuclear terror.
</S>
<S s_id="34">
The Pakistani president signed off by telling how much he admired the scientist.
</S>
<S s_id="35">
"All the proliferation, unfortunately, was under the supervision or orders of Dr. A.Q. Khan" Musharraf told a news conference, quickly adding that Khan is "still my hero" for developing atomic weapons for Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="36">
"Dr. A.Q. Khan has made Pakistan a nuclear power," said Musharraf.
</S>
<S s_id="37">
"I want to protect his honor."
</S>
<S s_id="38">
Musharraf insisted that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of Khan's extensive proliferation network because the scientist had amassed enormous autonomy during the previous two decades as he developed nuclear weapons for Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="39">
The general accused the governments of Libya and Iran of ratting on Khan to the IAEA.
</S>
<S s_id="40">
"Muslim brothers did not ask us before giving our names," Musharraf complained.
</S>
<S s_id="41">
Khan has been under house arrest since.
</S>
<S s_id="42">
Musharraf's eagerness to whisk the matter out of sight reflects a harsh political fact of life for the 61-year-old general.
</S>
<S s_id="43">
Khan is a hero in Pakistan and throughout the Islamic world for perfecting his country's first nuclear weapon -- and, by definition, the much-anticipated first "Muslim bomb."
</S>
<S s_id="44">
Pakistan exploded a series of atomic bombs in 1998, bringing that country into nuclear parity with archrival India, with whom it has fought three wars.
</S>
<S s_id="45">
Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka and adviser to prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, says Khan is so popular in Pakistan that if he announced he wanted his countrymen to give him money, "150 million Pakistanis would give it to him.
</S>
<S s_id="46">
Pakistani kids would empty their pockets for him."
</S>
<S s_id="47">
Haqqani teaches international relations at Boston University and is author of the forthcoming book, "Pakistan between Mosque and Military."
</S>
<S s_id="48">
Musharraf presides over a nation festering with Islamic militants, with large segments of the population sympathetic to al-Qaida and remnants of the fundamentalist Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the U.S. military toppled three years ago.
</S>
<S s_id="49">
The general is in no position to get tough with Khan by, for example, putting him on trial, especially since such a step would appear to be catering to the United States, which is widely unpopular throughout the country.
</S>
<S s_id="50">
Pakistan's religious parties already are angry with Musharraf for placing Khan along with at least a half-dozen of his associates under house arrest.
</S>
<S s_id="51">
Musharraf won't let U.S. investigators or officials from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency question Khan directly ("It's a matter of national pride" he says) to find out more about his far-flung proliferation network.
</S>
<S s_id="52">
From the Pakistani dictator's point of view, the least said about Khan, the better.
</S>
<S s_id="53">
The Pakistani leader, who has narrowly escaped two assassination attempts, keeps one eye nervously focused at all times on how Islamic militants in his nation react to his policies, especially when they involve coordination with the United States.
</S>
<S s_id="54">
And there is a huge amount of coordination.
</S>
<S s_id="55">
Powell said he speaks with Musharraf more than with any other foreign leader.
</S>
<S s_id="56">
"We talk all the time," Powell said of the estimated 90 conversations he said they have had.
</S>
<S s_id="57">
The Bush administration is also tiptoeing around the Khan case.
</S>
<S s_id="58">
Because Musharraf is a key ally in the U.S. war against terrorism -- after the Sept. 11 strikes he agreed to withdraw support for the Taliban, a regime that had supported al-Qaida -- the Bush administration doesn't want to add to Musharraf's precarious domestic circumstances by pushing too hard to gain access to Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="59">
Another reason the Bush administration is eager to let the Khan case gently disappear is that it represents a failure of American intelligence and diplomacy that one man -- the leading nuclear scientist of a U.S. ally -- could do so much damage for so long and escape detection.
</S>
<S s_id="60">
The U.S. silent treatment for Khan also spares the administration from embarrassing comparisons with another intelligence failure -- the flawed prediction that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, the administration's stated reason for invading that country.
</S>
<S s_id="61">
In the one case, U.S. intelligence flunked with its "slam dunk" certainty that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
</S>
<S s_id="62">
In the other case, U.S. intelligence failed to detect the massive nuclear proliferation program based in Pakistan, an American ally.
</S>
<S s_id="63">
Khan did much, much more to foster the spread of nuclear weapons than Saddam Hussein ever did.
</S>
<S s_id="64">
In their eagerness to downplay the Khan case, American officials have tried to make it sound like ancient history.
</S>
<S s_id="65">
For example, during last fall's election campaign, President Bush declared that Khan's nuclear network "has been brought to justice."
</S>
<S s_id="66">
Similarly, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asserted that Khan's operations have been "rolled upThe network is gone."
</S>
<S s_id="67">
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's former national security adviser and secretary of state-designate, called Khan's house arrest a sufficient penalty that matched the crime.
</S>
<S s_id="68">
"A.Q. Khan in a sense, has been brought to justice because he is out of the business that he loved most," she said.
</S>
<S s_id="69">
But the IAEA is not as cheery.
</S>
<S s_id="70">
"While we believe we have identified the major players and suppliers, we have not yet satisfied ourselves that we have got all of the subcontractors.
</S>
<S s_id="71">
Nor have we accounted for all the material that was produced for the network.
</S>
<S s_id="72">
Begging the question, where is it?" said Mark Gwozdecky, the IAEA spokeman.
</S>
<S s_id="73">
The State Department's Bureau of Non-Proliferation, the lead U.S. agency for preventing the global spread of weapons of mass destruction, has declined to discuss the Khan case.
</S>
<S s_id="74">
"They just feel it's too sensitive and that there is nothing new they feel they can say," said Jim Kelman, a State Department spokesman.
</S>
<S s_id="75">
Born in Bhopal, India in 1936, A. Q. Kahn and his family migrated to Pakistan in 1952 five years after the country was formed in a bloody partition with India.
</S>
<S s_id="76">
Khan came from modest means -- his father was a teacher but stressed the value of education as a way to rise above the crippling poverty that pervades much of Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="77">
Like many Pakistanis of his generation, Khan's worldview was shaped by Pakistan's opening conflict with India during the partition.
</S>
<S s_id="78">
In a 2001 interview, Khan said that when he was a youth in the late 1940s, during the height of the partition conflict, he recalled train after train "full of dead Muslims" pulling into a local train station.
</S>
<S s_id="79">
When Khan's family -- and thousands of other Muslims -- left India for Pakistan, Indian soldiers stripped them of their valuables, a loss of dignity that left a lasting impression on the youngster.
</S>
<S s_id="80">
"I had been traveling with a pen that my brother gave me when I passed my exams, and just as I was crossing out of India, a border guard reached towards me and snatched it from my pocket," Khan said.
</S>
<S s_id="81">
"The pen had almost no monetary value, but the guard's behavior hurt me, and it was something I'll never forget."
</S>
<S s_id="82">
Khan trained as an engineer at the University of Karachi, where he obtained his bachelors of science degree in 1960, and then obtained advanced metallurgical training in the then-West Germany, Belgium and Holland.
</S>
<S s_id="83">
In the 1970s, Khan worked in Europe for Urenco, a consortium funded by the British, Dutch and German governments that manufactured high-speed centrifuges that produce enriched uranium U-235 by spinning uranium hexafluoride gas.
</S>
<S s_id="84">
It's the U-235 that comprises uranium-fueled atomic bombs.
</S>
<S s_id="85">
Khan later stole centrifuge designs and fled to Pakistan in 1976 where he ran the country's nuclear program for the next 25 years.
</S>
<S s_id="86">
In 1983 a Dutch court convicted him in absentia for stealing nuclear secrets and sentenced him to four years in prison, but the conviction was later overturned on a technicality.
</S>
<S s_id="87">
Those secrets greatly advanced Pakistan's nuclear program that culminated in the 1998 atomic test explosions.
</S>
<S s_id="88">
Khan received his nation's highest civilian honors for his contributions.
</S>
<S s_id="89">
The scientist is something of a Renaissance man.
</S>
<S s_id="90">
Married to a South African, he has westernized tastes, is fluent in English and Dutch, an animal lover who takes in stray dogs, raises peacocks and enjoys feeding wild monkeys.
</S>
<S s_id="91">
He has a special fondness for Urdhu poetry and beautiful houses (he has owned properties in Pakistan, Mali and Dubai) and expensive cars.
</S>
<S s_id="92">
A father of two, he is a self-described " kindest person," who has funded charities and medical clinics for the poor in Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="93">
Pakistanis who have met him describe Khan as passionate about public issues, always ready with an opinion on science, politics, religion and foreign affairs.
</S>
<S s_id="94">
At times garrulous and gregarious, Khan is described as polite and witty.
</S>
<S s_id="95">
"He is humble and not outwardly arrogant," said Hassan Abbas, a former Pakistani security official and author of " Pakistan's Drift into Extremism."
</S>
<S s_id="96">
But in his infrequent interviews and public statements, Khan has revealed another side: He is a virulent Muslim nationalist with an Islamist's hatred of the United States, Israel and the West.
</S>
<S s_id="97">
"All the western countries, including Israel, are not only Pakistan's enemies but also enemies of Islam," he charged in a 1984 interview.
</S>
<S s_id="98">
He called the U.S. effort to prevent the flow of nuclear technology around the globe "part of the crusades which the Christians and Jews had initiated against the Muslims 1,000 years ago."
</S>
<S s_id="99">
Like many Muslims, Khan has spoken of a worldwide "Zionist" conspiracy to rob Muslim nations of their power and glory.
</S>
<S s_id="100">
In a 2001 interview, Khan said the longstanding rumors about his work in nuclear proliferation were "unsubstantiated and fabricated lies" fomented by foreign governments "because I disturbed all their strategic plans, the balance of power and blackmailing potential in this part of the world" by building a nuclear arsenal for Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="101">
"I am not a madman or a nut," he added.
</S>
<S s_id="102">
U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies had long suspected Khan of running a vast nuclear proliferation enterprise and, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell, the Bush administration was "well aware of his activities" in 2001.
</S>
<S s_id="103">
In a recent paid speech after he left his post as CIA director, George Tenet said the CIA's involvement in breaking up A. Q. Khan's proliferation operation dated to 1997.
</S>
<S s_id="104">
"Working with British colleagues, we pieced together his subsidiaries, his clients, his front companies, his finances and manufacturing plants," Tenet said, according to an audiotape of the speech obtained by the New York Times.
</S>
<S s_id="105">
"We were inside his residence, inside his facilities, inside his rooms.
</S>
<S s_id="106">
We were everywhere these people were."
</S>
<S s_id="107">
Tenet said the Khan operation stretched across three continents and called the bust "one of the greatest success stories nobody ever talks about."
</S>
<S s_id="108">
As U.S. and British intelligence worked to uncover the Khan network, the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency proceeded on a parallel track.
</S>
<S s_id="109">
By the spring of 2003, Iranian leaders had told IAEA officials about a black market where they had been buying nuclear material for the previous 18 years.
</S>
<S s_id="110">
The Iranians claimed they were working through middlemen and were not aware of the identity of the suppliers, according to Mark Gwozdecky, the spokesman for IAEA.
</S>
<S s_id="111">
Around the same time, the Americans and British reaped the benefits of the close surveillance of Khan's operations.
</S>
<S s_id="112">
They were tracking the shipment of nuclear parts to Libya.
</S>
<S s_id="113">
Italy intercepted once such shipment on a cargo ship in October 2003 that was carrying centrifuge parts.
</S>
<S s_id="114">
Confronted with the evidence, and given Libya's desire to end longstanding economic sanctions, Tripoli confessed and renounced its nuclear program.
</S>
<S s_id="115">
After Libya invited IAEA inspectors in December 2003, they uncovered a trove of incriminating evidence pointing to Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="116">
"Libya helps fill in the blanks.
</S>
<S s_id="117">
They were working directly with Khan and provided IAEA information about the actual supply chain," Gwozdecky said.
</S>
<S s_id="118">
The IAEA believes Khan's network provided Libya with uranium hexafluoride, the raw material used in centrifuges to produce enriched uranium.
</S>
<S s_id="119">
The network also provided the industrial help necessary for Libya to make its own uranium hexafluoride, as well as centrifuge and atomic bomb designs and machine shop equipment to service the centrifuges.
</S>
<S s_id="120">
Much of this material has been dismantled in Libya and shipped to the United States where it is being studied at the Energy Department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., facilities.
</S>
<S s_id="121">
Iran also received Khan's help on centrifuge technology, according to a CIA report to Congress.
</S>
<S s_id="122">
And the CIA says Khan sold nuclear materials to North Korea.
</S>
<S s_id="123">
At a minimum, Khan provided a turn-key nuclear bomb program to Libya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran, a country that sponsors terrorist organizations.
</S>
<S s_id="124">
"Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn't been for Khan," said David Albright, a leading nuclear expert and president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a non-proliferation think-tank.
</S>
<S s_id="125">
Khan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs because they allow the development of bomb-making material with greater secrecy, compared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U-235.
</S>
<S s_id="126">
"Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy-and-time consuming than gaseous diffusion, and you can hide it a lot easier," said Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington, D.C.
</S>
<S s_id="127">
U.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency are trying to determine whether A. Q. Khan or Iran, Libya or North Korea shared nuclear know-how with third parties, like al-Qaida.
</S>
<S s_id="128">
The terrorist group has been pursuing atomic weapons and has said that it would use nuclear bombs against the United States.
</S>
<S s_id="129">
Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Pakistan detained two of its nuclear scientists on suspicion that they shared nuclear information with Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaida chief.
</S>
<S s_id="130">
Although they were subsequently released, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists "may have provided some assistance to al-Qaida's program" to acquire nuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent report to Congress.
</S>
<S s_id="131">
Based on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al-Qaida's atomic efforts "rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenous program is unclear."
</S>
<S s_id="132">
Investigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khan network and all of the companies around the globe that may have played a part.
</S>
<S s_id="133">
There are at least 30 companies in 30 countries "all over the globe involved in this fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr. A.Q. Khan acting as CEO," according to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of the IAEA.
</S>
<S s_id="134">
Major elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia and South Africa.
</S>
<S s_id="135">
Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman -- Bukhary Syed Abu Tahir -- who admitted shipping nuclear components to Iran and Libya at Khan's behest.
</S>
<S s_id="136">
Tahir also admitted receiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iran in exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.
</S>
<S s_id="137">
In South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weapons technology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="138">
Three individuals allegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, were arrested as part of the South African investigation.
</S>
<S s_id="139">
Khan, the one person who could provide answers to the many pending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA and U.S. intelligence agencies.
</S>
<S s_id="140">
Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officers to talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questions to him.
</S>
<S s_id="141">
The problem with that arrangement is that investigators can't be sure whether it's Khan -- or someone else -- answering the questions.
</S>
<S s_id="142">
Nonetheless, a Vienna-based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative with U.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators have uncovered concerning Khan's operations.
</S>
<S s_id="143">
Cooperation between Pakistani government and the U.S. and IAEA "has moved slowly but positively," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="144">
The IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessman currently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame better questions to Khan, the diplomat said.
</S>
<S s_id="145">
In addition, the IAEA has requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators to examine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges.
</S>
<S s_id="146">
By comparing the Pakistan models with those in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran's centrifuges originated in Pakistan.
</S>
<S s_id="147">
Given that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is all-powerful there and that A. Q. Khan was such a high-profile figure, some experts scoff at Musharraf's insistence that he didn't know about Khan's nuclear black marketeering.
</S>
<S s_id="148">
Husain Haqqani, the former Pakistani ambassador to Sri Lanka, said in an interview that "one would have to stretch the bounds of credulity to believe that the government wasn't involved."
</S>
<S s_id="149">
"It's hard to believe that Pakistan's top scientist could travel to places like North Korea without the government's knowledge," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="150">
Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, gives Musharraf and other senior leaders the benefit of the doubt, speculating that the general may have been shielded from full knowledge of Khan's proliferation activities.
</S>
<S s_id="151">
"Did Pakistan's military know something was going on?
</S>
<S s_id="152">
I'd say yes, Did they know everything?
</S>
<S s_id="153">
Probably not," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="154">
Oakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creation but rather reversed the flow of information and material on the import network that Khan and the Pakistan military had used to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.
</S>
<S s_id="155">
The assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that, at a minimum, Khan must have had help from other senior scientists in the Pakistani government.
</S>
<S s_id="156">
"Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges," a Vienna-based diplomat said.
</S>
<S s_id="157">
"But he wouldn't necessarily understand bomb designs nor would he understand uranium conversion and the many other technologies involved."
</S>
<S s_id="158">
The Bush administration, always working to build-up Musharraf, has accepted his claims of innocence.
</S>
<S s_id="159">
Secretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf if he had known about Khan's work, the general denied any knowledge.
</S>
<S s_id="160">
Khan's nuclear network "was so compartmented within government circles" and Musharraf was "outside the circle," Powell said of Musharraf's explanation.
</S>
<S s_id="161">
"That's what he has said to me, and I have no evidence to prove or disprove his statement."
</S>
<S s_id="162">
All of which leads to the question of motive, another major thrust in the IAEA investigation.
</S>
<S s_id="163">
While Khan profited financially from the sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not the sole motivation.
</S>
<S s_id="164">
The IAEA's ElBaradei has said that "ideology" also played a factor.
</S>
<S s_id="165">
For example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khan may have been motivated by the strategic view held by some Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was a way to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears is an emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.
</S>
<S s_id="166">
While Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, he may also have been motivated by a pan-Muslim view of spreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.

"Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convoluted strategic thinking," said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.
