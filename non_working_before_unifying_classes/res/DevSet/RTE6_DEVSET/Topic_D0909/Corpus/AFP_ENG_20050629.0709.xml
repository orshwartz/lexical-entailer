</S>
<S s_id="1">
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Wednesday with British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain and reaffirmed support for the implementation of the Good Friday accords.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
The 1998 Good Friday peace deal largely ended three decades of intercommunity violence in Northern Ireland and established a power-sharing executive and assembly.

"The United States continues to support fully the British and Irish governments' efforts to implement the Good Friday Accords," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
The United States, he said, welcomed statements made this week by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern that the key to moving forward was for the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, to end all violence unequivocally.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
Blair and Ahern underlined their desire for the quick return of a self-governing Northern Ireland and urged the IRA to cooperate.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
They warned that such a government would only be achieved provided that peace prevailed in the British-ruled province.
