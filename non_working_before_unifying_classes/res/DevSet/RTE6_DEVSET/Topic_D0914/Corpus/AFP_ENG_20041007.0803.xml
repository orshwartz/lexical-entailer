A suspected car bomb ripped through a hotel on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, one of three explosions targeting Israelis that left at least 30 people dead and scores more wounded.

Israeli public television, citing a police source, said a powerful car bomb detonated close to the entrance of the Hilton hotel in the beach resort of Taba just across the border from Israel, destroying a 30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows.

The power went off," a witness who gave his name as Eitan told Israeli radio.

Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an Arab country.

But Taba, which in ancient times was once a resting point for caravans en route to the Fort of Aqaba, was excluded from Israel's 1982 handover of the Sinai and was only returned in 1989 after years of wranging following a ruling by the International Court of Justice.

Ties between the two neighbours have soured since the start of the Palestinian intifada or uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago.

But thousands of Israeli tourists are still drawn to the Sinai, especially for its outstanding Red Sea diving and its hotel casinos, banned in the Jewish state.

The Jerusalem Post reported on September 11, after the government travel advisory, that vacationing Israelis were continuing to flock to the Sinai, despite repeated warnings of attacks.

It estimated that over the past summer alone, around 300,000 Israelis took holidays in Sinai, replacing Turkey as Israelis' most popular tourist destination.

Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's Shin Beth domestic security agency, told the cabinet on September 19 that prompt action had thwarted a plot by Palestinian militants to strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.
</S>

Dichter said the attack had been planned by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas to coincide with the Jewish new year holidays between September 15 and 18.

Hamas had threatened to strike Israeli targets abroad after the killing of a top militant in the Syrian capital of Damascus last month that was blamed on Israel.
