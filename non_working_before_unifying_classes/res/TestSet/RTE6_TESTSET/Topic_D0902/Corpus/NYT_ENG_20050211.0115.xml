ABORTION SHOULD BE RARE -- AND HERE'S HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Over the years, I have met very few women who didn't regret their abortions.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
But I haven't talked to a single woman who regretted having the child she had considered aborting.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
That's why U.S. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's recent candor on abortion -- that it should be rare, but legal -- was welcome.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
What we need now is this sort of honest discussion of the issue that reflects current realities and values.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
American opinion has shifted since 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the landmark Roe vs. Wade case.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Medical advancements that permit women to hear their baby's heartbeat at four weeks, see their fingers and toes at 10 weeks and allow babies to survive outside the womb at 24 weeks have influenced our perception of when life begins.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
Like most Catholics, I oppose abortion.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
But like most Americans, I don't want the government deciding the issue for a woman.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Abortion should remain legal.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
Never again should women be forced to back alleys or foreign countries to terminate their pregnancies -- particularly if they've been raped or if pregnancy poses a life-threatening risk to a mother.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
We do have the power to make abortions rare, and it can be done without passing a law.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
But we need better choices than those of the moralizing right, whose restrictive policies on sex education, emergency contraception (the morning after pill) and medical care for the working poor force many women to choose between an abortion and rearing a child in poverty.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Their efforts to keep young people ignorant about sex -- with abstinence-only sex education -- deprives many of them of the knowledge they need to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
In the United States, 19 percent of women who get abortions are teenagers.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
The liberals are no better.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Their abortion-on-demand policies ignore medical advancements and evolving societal values.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
It has become difficult to think of a living, growing organism with a heartbeat and brain as merely a fetus -- whether it is a few weeks or several months old.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
It's not a stretch to visualize a time in the near future when babies will be able to survive outside the womb much earlier than they do today.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
At some point, the left needs to accept that most Americans have grown uncomfortable with the practice of terminating pregnancies to avoid responsibility of rearing children and with partial-birth abortions that are done after the first trimester.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
Texas' law that requires parents to be notified (or a review by a judge) if their minor children seek an abortion is a reasonable restriction that respects the sensibilities of most Texans.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
But the State Board of Education's backward move to prevent sex education regarding condoms and other contraceptives from reaching Texas classrooms runs counter to most parents' sentiments.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
It doesn't help that so many Texas children are languishing in state foster homes.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
These are minority kids, mostly African-American.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
Mothers who can't raise their children face the heartbreaking prospect of giving their babies over to a callous system that passes them from one stranger's arms to another.
</S>
<S s_id="25">
We could make real progress in reducing abortions if groups on both sides used their resources to help women overcome the conditions that make abortions so appealing.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
More than 1 million abortions are preformed each year in this country.
</S>
<S s_id="27">
That's a tragedy.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
Outlawing abortion isn't the answer.
</S>
<S s_id="29">
Legal or not, abortions will continue until women no longer have to seriously contemplate whether their babies would be better off if they were never born.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
What a choice.
</S>
