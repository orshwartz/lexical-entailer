Pakistan skeptical over claim its scientist gave nuclear bomb
blueprint to Iran
</S>
<S s_id="1">
The government expressed skepticism Thursday over a claim by an Iranian opposition group that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced father of Pakistan's nuclear program, had given Iran a blueprint for a nuclear bomb and some weapons-grade uranium.

"We do not attach importance to this report or claim," Foreign Ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a news conference in the capital, Islamabad.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
"The validity of this claim is being questioned and it is being viewed with skepticism."
</S>

Pakistan's official reaction came a day after Farid Soleimani, a former senior official for the National Council for Resistance in Iran, told reporters in Vienna that Tehran received the bomb diagram between 1994 and 1996 and a quantity of highly enriched uranium from Khan in 2001.

While the Pakistani spokesman dismissed the claim, he said its investigations into the unauthorized spread of nuclear technology were yet not closed.

<S s_id="6">
Masood Khan said Pakistan had not received a report through formal channels on the claim, and it was open to "any communication."
</S>
<S s_id="7">
Pakistan has said it is cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency in its investigations into the international nuclear black market, although it has not let the agency question Khan.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
Khan has been under virtual house arrest in Islamabad since a scandal broke in December over his alleged black market dealings that supplied nuclear weapons technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
President Gen. Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan _ long revered in Pakistan for helping build a nuclear deterrent against rival India _ after he made a public confession in February.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
All but one of Khan's colleagues have been released after questioning.
