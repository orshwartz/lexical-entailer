pick

US President George W. Bush on Wednesday chastised critics of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as a potential candidate for the recently-vacated seat in the Supreme Court.

"I don't like it when a friend gets criticized.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
I'm loyal to my friends," the US leader said of Gonzales during a brief stop in Denmark on Wednesday before attending the G8 summit in Scotland.

Republicans and Democrats are geared up for a major political fight over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement last Friday.

The vacancy handed Bush his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the nine-member high court, which has immense influence over the lives of Americans as it interprets the constitution.

Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" who could undermine women's right to have an abortion, while Republicans have urged him to pick a strict conservative.

Speculation has circled around Gonzales, who has been criticized by both liberals and conservatives, especially for his role in the controversial US policy towards terrorist suspects in captivity.

<S s_id="8">
"(A)ll of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire...
</S>
<S s_id="9">
I don't like it at all," Bush told reporters gathered outside Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen's country residence, just north of Copenhagen.

The US leader also reiterated that there would be "no litmus test" on controversial issues like abortion or gay marriage for nominees to the Supreme Court position.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
"(A)s I said during both of my campaigns, there will be no litmus test.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
I'll pick people who... will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to legislate from," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Bush's visit, his first to Denmark but his fifth meeting with Rasmussen since 2002, was seen by commentators as a symbolic gesture thanking Denmark for supporting the war in Iraq, where it has deployed more than 500 troops near the southern city of Basra.
