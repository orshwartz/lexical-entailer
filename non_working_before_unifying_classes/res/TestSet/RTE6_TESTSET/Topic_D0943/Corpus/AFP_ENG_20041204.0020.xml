Judge reserves decision in Air India terrorism trial by Deborah Jones
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Two men charged with murder and conspiracy in the Air India bombings, the world's most lethal terror strike prior to September 11, 2001, will wait until March to hear a verdict, a judge said Friday.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
After 19 months of complex hearings, the massive trial of Ajaib Singh Bagri and Ripudaman Singh Malik ended Friday with lawyers on all sides trying to score a few last points.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
Justice Ian Bruce Josephson, who heard the case without a jury in this western Canadian city, said he will reveal his decision March 16.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
Bagri and Malik, who were arrested in 2000, are each charged with eight counts related to two bombings on June 23, 1985.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
On that day a suitcase bomb exploded at Japan's Narita airport, killing two Japanese baggage handlers as they transferred it to an Air India jet.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
Less than an hour later, Air India Flight 182 exploded off the Irish coast, killing all 329 aboard.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
John Ward of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police told reporters that 250 officers have worked on the case since 1985.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
The investigation into more suspects continues, he said.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
"We still have 12 RCMP officers working on this case.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
We're not done yet."
</S>
<S s_id="11">
Prosecution spokesperson Geoffrey Gaul said 113 witnesses testified for the government and for Bagri and Malik's defence teams.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
The trial was held behind bullet-resistant glass in a specially-built, secure, 7.5-million-dollar (6.3 million US) underground courtroom.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Bagri, a Sikh preacher and rural millworker, and Malik, a millionaire Vancouver businessman, maintained their innocence.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
The pair is accused of taking part in a plot by Sikh fundamentalists to build two bombs and plant them on two flights leaving Vancouver that connected with Air India flights to London and Delhi.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Government prosecutors contend that Malik arranged and paid for the airline tickets used to check the suitcase bombs onto planes, and that Bagri arranged to get the bombs to the airport.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
The motive in targetting the Indian planes, said Gaul, was to fight for the cause of an independent Sikh homeland, to be called Khalistan, and avenge India's 1984 attack on the Sikh Golden Temple at Amritsar.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
The alleged mastermind of the plot, Talwinder Singh Parmar, was killed in a police shootout in India in 1992.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
Nearly 20 years will have elapsed by the time Josephson rules on the guilt of the two men, who emigrated to Canada from Punjab.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
A third man in Canada, Inderjit Singh Reyat, pled guilty in 2003 to manslaughter for his role in providing material for the bomb on Flight 182, and was sentenced to five years.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
The Air India bombing stood as the worst terror attack in modern history, until it was overtaken by the carnage of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States in 2001.
