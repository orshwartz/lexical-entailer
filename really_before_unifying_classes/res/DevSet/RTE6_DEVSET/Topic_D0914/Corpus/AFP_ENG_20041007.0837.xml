At least 30 killed as suspected car bombs rock Egypt's Red Sea coast

Suspected car bombs ripped through a hotel and two beachside tourist sites on the Red Sea coast of Egypt's Sinai desert late Thursday, killing at least 30 people, most of them Israelis.

"We know dozens of Israelis have been killed," an Israeli police source said after a massive explosion devastated the Hilton hotel in Taba, a tiny town just across the border from Israel.

Egyptian Tourism Minister Ahmed al-Maghrabi put the toll at more than 30 dead and 100 wounded from the three explosions in Taba and two other resorts on the south Sinai coast, an area popular with Israeli holidaymakers.
</S>

The explosions occurred as Israelis were celebrating the end of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, and followed intelligence warnings that Israelis should keep out of the Sinai because of possible attacks.

Ambulances were shuttling across the border checkpoint between Taba and the Israeli resort of Eilat, where hospital staff wheeled in bloodied victims, including children, on stretchers.

Israeli investigators believe a powerful car bomb detonated near the entrance to the four-star Hilton, destroying much of the building.
</S>

Some debris from the vehicle used has been found by investigators, Israeli radio said.

South Sinai governor General Mustafa Afifi said two charred trucks were found at the two tourist camps of Shitani and Ras Soltan on the coast road of the desert peninsula south of Taba, suggesting that the blasts were also caused by car bombs.

"At this time of year, most guests at the Taba hotel are Israelis, along with a small number of Egyptians and some tourists of other nationalities," Maghrabi told AFP.

Egypt threw up a security cordon around the blast sites in the Sinai -- renowned for its dramatic desert mountains and palm-fringed beaches -- and boosted airport security in Cairo.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
A previously unknown Islamist group claimed responsibility for the Hilton blast in a telephone call to AFP in Jerusalem.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
"Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya (World Islamist Group) claims responsibility for the explosion at the Taba hotel, carried out in revenge for the Palestinian and Arab martyrs dying in Palestine and Iraq," the caller said.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip, a wedge of land near the border with Egypt, that has left 93 Palestinians dead in less than 10 days.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
"I am standing in front of the hotel.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
I heard a big explosion about 30 minutes ago that smashed all the windows.

The power went off," a witness who gave his name as Eitan told Israeli radio.

Resorts dotted along the Sinai's desert coast have remained popular holiday spots for Israelis since the territory was handed back to Egypt as part of a 1979 peace deal, the first between Israel and an Arab countryis were continuing to flock to the Sinai despite the warnings.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
The Jerusalem Post estimated that over the past summer alone, around 300,000 Israelis took holidays in Sinai, replacing Turkey as Israelis' most popular tourist destination.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
Avi Dichter, the head of Israel's Shin Beth domestic security agency, told the cabinet on September 19 that prompt action had thwarted a plot by Palestinian militant group Hamas to strike Israeli tourists in the Sinai.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
Hamas had threatened to strike Israeli targets abroad after the killing of a top militant in the Syrian capital of Damascus last month that was blamed on Israel.
