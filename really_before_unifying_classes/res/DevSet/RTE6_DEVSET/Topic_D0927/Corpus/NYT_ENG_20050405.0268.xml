ABC'S JENNINGS DISCLOSES THAT HE HAS LUNG CANCER
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, the sole anchor of the ABC evening newscast for the past 22 years, announced Tuesday that he was suffering from lung cancer and had begun treatment.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
ABC said Jennings, 66, would work as often as he could during his course of treatment.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
But the network, which has seen the recent replacement of anchors at NBC and CBS as an opportunity for Jennings to vault into the ratings leadership, is planning to use substitute anchors, including Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas, in his absence.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
Jennings was unable to anchor the ABC newscast on Tuesday night, though he had originally planned to.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
He did tape a brief commentary to close the newscast, speaking in a hoarse and strained voice.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
He said: "The National Cancer Institute says that we are survivors from the moment of diagnosis.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
I will continue to do the broadcast.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
On good days, my voice will not always be like this.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Certainly, it's been a long time.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
And I hope it goes without saying that a journalist who doesn't value -- deeply -- the audience's loyalty should be in another line of work."
</S>
<S s_id="11">
ABC News emphasized that Jennings would remain its evening news anchor.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
In an e-mail message to his staff on Tuesday, David Westin, the president of ABC News, praised Jennings for his leadership of the news division over the years and expressed the division's support as he encountered this challenge.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
"Peter will once again lead the way but we will stand with him at every turn," Westin said.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
He added that Jennings would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and would continue to work on the newscast "to the extent he can do so comfortably."
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Jennings had been a heavy smoker until the mid- to late-1980s, colleagues said.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
He quit at that time, though the colleagues said it was an enormous struggle for him and periodically he was known to sneak a cigarette or two.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
At one point, Jennings and his executive producer then, Paul Friedman, visited a hypnotist in Boston seeking to break their addictions to cigarettes.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
That treatment worked for a time, but as Jennings acknowledged in his commentary on Tuesday night, he returned to regular smoking after the terrorist attacks in 2001.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
He later quit again, a colleague said.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
Lung cancer is usually difficult to treat.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
While the prognosis depends on the type of lung cancer, the overall cure rate is just 16 percent.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
Sixty percent of lung cancer patients die within a year of diagnosis, and nearly 75 percent die within two years.
