"The memorial will be the centerpiece and our first priority in the rebuilding effort," Pataki said at a luncheon event in New York City.

"Reflecting Absence" by architect Michael Arad, which features two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens, was chosen from 5,201 entries submitted to an international design competition.

The pools are to sit almost empty, with water running down the sides only, symbolizing the vacuum left by the 2,749 people who died when two hijacked planes were crashed into the trade center's twin towers.

The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.
