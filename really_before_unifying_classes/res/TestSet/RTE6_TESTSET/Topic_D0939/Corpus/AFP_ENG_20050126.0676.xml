Ten people were killed and more than 100 injured Wednesday when two commuter trains slammed into each other after one of them hit a car left on the lines by a suicidal man, police said.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
A murder investigation was launched as the death toll rose following the horrific early morning crash involving three trains and a sports utility vehicle in the heavily-populated Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.
</S>

Rescuers were picking through the mangled wreckage of the trains that collided with an explosive crash just after 6:00 am (1400 GMT) after one of them derailed as it ploughed into the abandoned vehicle.

"We have 10 fatalities so far and well over 100 injured," Glendale Police Chief Randy Adams told reporters, adding that the probe into the accident had turned into a homicide investigation.

"This whole incident was started by a deranged individual who was suicidal," he said announcing that the depressed driver, identified as Juan Manuel Alvarez, 26, was unhurt and was in custody.
</S>

The driver allegedly manoeuvred his Jeep onto the tracks, where it became stuck, and waited for a train to end his life, according to Adams and other police officials.

"He was intent at that time on taking his own life but changed his mind," Adams told reporters.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
"He exited the vehicle and stood by as a southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train," the police chief said.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
After hitting the car, the packed rush-hour train, which was bound for Los Angeles' Union Station, jumped its tracks and jack-knifed into the path of an oncoming commuter train heading in the opposite direction.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
One of the stricken trains then side-swiped a stationary freight train that was parked on a side-track in the area, knocking it over, officials said.

Carnage ensued.

"It sounded like thunder," said Karen Mendoza, an employee at a nearby wholesale store who called emergency services when she heard the accident.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Some passengers had to be cut from the wreckage, which was strewn over a wide area, while others were forced to jump to safety from the burning upper decks of railway carriages that caught fire in the impact.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
At least 89 people were rushed to hospital as a hundreds of rescuers and convoys of ambulances flooded the crash scene.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Some 200 people, mostly walking wounded, were examined by medical staff at the scene as they prioritised treatment for the wounded, firefighters said.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Passengers were tossed around the inside of their trains and some had to jump from the upper decks of the wreckage, eyewitnesses told reporters.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Most of the injuries suffered by victims were "crush-type" wounds similar to those that occur in car crashes, said Carol Meyer of the Los Angeles County emergency medical services.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
Many of the patients had head, chest and abdominal injuries, she added.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
The Los Angeles Police Department declared a citywide tactical alert that allows commanders to keep officers on the job beyond the end of their shifts, in order to help with the rescue and crowd control operations.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
Meanwhile the driver of the vehicle that sparked the incident was expected to be charged with murder, police said.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
"You don't put your car on the track and put yourself in harm's way and all these passengers in harm's way," said Los Angeles Sheriff Lee Baca, one of whose deputies was among the dead.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
"This is a complete outrage."
