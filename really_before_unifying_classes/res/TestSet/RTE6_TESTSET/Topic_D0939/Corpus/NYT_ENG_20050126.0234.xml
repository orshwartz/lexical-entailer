AT LEAST 10 DEAD, NEARLY 200 HURT IN 3-TRAIN WRECK IN CALIFORNIA; SUSPECT IS HELD
</S>
<S s_id="1">
A man whom police described as deranged and bent on suicide abandoned a light truck on a heavily traveled commuter rail track here early Wednesday, causing a violent wreck involving three trains that left at least 10 people dead and nearly 200 injured.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
The fierce collision at 6:02 a.m. left rail cars toppled and crushed like oversized toys and sparked immediate fears among Los Angeles-area police that the derailment was a terrorist act.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
A counterterrorism command post was set up near the crash site, but authorities determined within an hour that the disaster was almost certainly the work of one troubled man.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
Two hours after the crash, the rain-spattered scene between a Costco store and a warehouse still reeked of diesel fuel.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
The tracks were covered with tons of twisted metal and littered with rail car seats, suitcases, briefcases and clothing.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
A bicycle lay on its side and the gravel rail bed was stained with oil and blood.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
Rescue workers arrived quickly and were aided by Costco employees who pulled injured passengers from the smoking wreckage.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
More than 120 people, dozens of them with serious injuries, were transported to 15 area hospitals.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
"People were screaming, one lady was crying, people were moaning, all kinds of painful noises," said Richard Mendevil, who was on his way home to Santa Clarita from Los Angeles' Union Station in the northbound Metrolink train, when it was hit by a southbound train that had derailed after hitting the light truck and an idle Union Pacific work train.
</S>

Glendale police said that Juan Manuel Alvarez, 25, of the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, drove around barriers at a grade crossing and then up the Metrolink commuter rail tracks, where his Jeep Grand Cherokee became wedged between the rails.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
He apparently changed his mind about killing himself, abandoned the vehicle and watched the crash, the Glendale police chief, Randy G. Adams, said.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
Adams said that before driving onto the tracks Alvarez cut his wrists and stabbed himself in the chest, inflicting superficial wounds.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
He was treated for his injuries and taken into custody and will be charged with at least 10 counts of murder, the chief said.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
He said the crash was caused solely by the actions of the suspect.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
He and other law enforcement officials expressed dismay and anger at what they called a preventable man-made disaster.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
"I think his intent at that time was to take his own life, but changed his mind prior to the train actually striking this vehicle," Adams said.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
"He exited the vehicle and stood by as the southbound Metrolink train struck his vehicle, causing the train to derail and strike the northbound train."
</S>
<S s_id="18">
He said that Alvarez was cooperating with authorities and had acknowledged causing the wreck.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
"He was very distraught and upset when he realized he caused a major disaster," the chief said.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
Alvarez is in jail and under suicide watch, he added.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles County district attorney, said he would decide by the end of the week what charges he will bring against Alvarez.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
Metrolink is a commuter rail system serving five counties in Southern California since its formation in 1992.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
About 40,000 people ride the double-decker trains every day, officials said.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
The two trains that crashed on Wednesday typically carry between 230 and 300 people on weekdays.
</S>
<S s_id="25">
Wednesday's crash was the deadliest train accident in the United States since March 15, 1999, when an Amtrak train hit a truck and derailed near Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
A crash in Graniteville, S.C., earlier this month ruptured a chlorine tank, leaving nine people dead and 234 injured.
</S>
<S s_id="27">
The National Transportation Safety Board has sent a team to investigate.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
People on the train and in the neighborhood near the tracks saw Alvarez as he ran away from his vehicle.
</S>
<S s_id="29">
Slowed by his knife wounds, he was arrested quickly, police said.

Witnesses and survivors described a horrific collision that upended several double-decker rail cars and toppled a heavy diesel Union Pacific locomotive sitting idle on a side track.
</S>
<S s_id="32">
"I heard a noise.
</S>
<S s_id="33">
It got louder and louder," Diane Brady, 56, a passenger from Simi Valley, told the Associated Press.
</S>
<S s_id="34">
"And next thing I knew the train tilted, everyone was screaming and I held onto a pole for dear life.
</S>
<S s_id="35">
I held on for what seemed like a week and a half, it seemed.
</S>
<S s_id="36">
It was a complete nightmare."
</S>
<S s_id="37">
One injured man trapped in the wreckage scrawled a note in his own blood on a seat cushion, according to Rex Vilaubi, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman.
</S>
<S s_id="38">
He wrote "I love my kids" and "I love Leslie" using the heart symbol, Vilaubi said.
</S>
<S s_id="39">
He said he did not know the man's name.

Mendevil, who was in the second car of the northbound train, said the collision came with no warning.
</S>
<S s_id="42">
"I was on the second floor walking down the aisle and saw the lights of the oncoming train and watched it pass and then I was thrown up in the air, landed on a table and rolled off onto the floor," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="43">
"The train tilted sideways and the lights flickered and went out."
</S>
<S s_id="44">
He said as he got up from the floor he saw a fire on the tracks and a man with blood streaming down his face staggering alongside the listing rail car.
</S>
<S s_id="45">
Mendevil said that although he was "pretty much in panic," he pried open a door and helped a woman out and away from the train.
</S>
<S s_id="46">
Mendevil, 25, was interviewed in the parking lot of the Costco store that became a command center and triage station for the crash.
</S>
<S s_id="47">
He was wearing a tag around his neck given to him by paramedics to keep track of the injured.
</S>
<S s_id="48">
He was treated at the scene and sent home.
</S>
<S s_id="49">
Mendevil said as he walked away from the wreckage, he saw the tailgate of a truck and a wheel and concluded that the train had hit a car or truck.
</S>
<S s_id="50">
"I got as far away as I could because I was worried about an explosion," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="51">
Costco workers attended to the injured and used carts that usually haul plywood to carry the injured to ambulances when paramedics ran out of gurneys.
</S>
<S s_id="52">
The store provided food and water for the hundreds of fire and rescue crews and media workers who descended on the crash site in the damp gloomy dawn.
</S>
<S s_id="53">
Firefighters went through the wreckage five times with dogs and listening devices before determining that all the passengers had been accounted for.
</S>
<S s_id="54">
Heavy equipment was then brought in to begin to clear the tracks, a process that will take several days, officials said.

Among the dead was Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy James Tutino, 47, a 23-year veteran of the department, who was commuting to downtown Los Angeles from his home in Simi Valley.
</S>
<S s_id="57">
Two other sheriff's deputies aboard the train were injured.
</S>
<S s_id="58">
"This is a complete outrage as far as traffic safety is concerned," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said.
</S>
<S s_id="59">
"When some individual parks his vehicle on the tracks that is cause for serious, serious alarm."

Mayor Bob Yousefian of Glendale called on federal transportation authorities to eliminate all grade crossings, which are responsible for scores of accidents and suicides each year around the country.
</S>
<S s_id="62">
Federal investigators said they did not know the exact number of motorists who have committed suicides at rail crossings.
</S>
<S s_id="63">
The police who investigate rail accidents are taught to look for signs of suicide, such as an absence of skid marks immediately before the crossing, indicating that the motorist saw the train and tried to stop.
</S>
<S s_id="64">
Suicides more commonly involve pedestrians who walk in front of trains than those who park cars on the tracks, investigators say.
</S>
<S s_id="65">
Wednesday's crash was the third fatal accident involving Metrolink in the past three years.
</S>
<S s_id="66">
In January 2003, a Metrolink train smashed into a truck and derailed, killing the motorist and injuring 32 train passengers.
</S>
<S s_id="67">
In April 2002, a freight train plowed into a stopped Metrolink train, leaving three passengers dead and 162 injured.
</S>
<S s_id="68">
David Solow, the chief executive officer of Metrolink, described how the disaster unfolded.
</S>
<S s_id="69">
Metrolink train 100, a four-car train being pushed by a locomotive, was southbound from Moorpark to Los Angeles and approaching the Glendale station at 6:02 a.m. when its front car hit Alvarez's Jeep.
</S>
<S s_id="70">
The front car, a so-called cab car, has a compartment in the front for the engineer when the locomotive is in the back.
</S>
<S s_id="71">
The rest of the two-story car carries passengers.
</S>
<S s_id="72">
Because Alvarez's truck was wedged between the rails and not sitting at a grade crossing, it became an "immovable object," Solow said, vaulting the front car of the train into the air and causing the cars behind it to twist on their couplings and fold in on each other like an accordion.
</S>
<S s_id="73">
The out-of-control train struck an idle Union Pacific work train on a track just west of the Metrolink rails, knocking the locomotive on its side.
</S>
<S s_id="74">
The train had numerous cars full of gravel and was preparing to go to Santa Barbara to repair tracks damaged in the recent California rainstorms.
</S>
<S s_id="75">
After striking the Union Pacific train, the southbound train slammed into an oncoming Metrolink train, number 901, northbound from Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.
</S>
<S s_id="76">
Trains on the line can travel as fast as 79 mph, but the two trains involved in the crash were probably going slower because the southbound train was approaching the Glendale station and the northbound train had just left it, Solow said.
</S>
<S s_id="77">
He said that the exact speeds, the various points of impact and the overall force of the collision would be determined by National Transportation Safety Board investigators.
</S>
<S s_id="78">
Solow said that Metrolink and most other passenger trains were designed to withstand a collision with a light vehicle stopped at a grade crossing.
</S>
<S s_id="79">
The cab car in the front of the southbound train has a reinforced frame that is designed to deflect or destroy vehicles parked at level grade crossings.
</S>
<S s_id="80">
"Normally at a grade crossing the car is smashed to smithereens and the train stays on the track," Solow said.
</S>
<S s_id="81">
"But this car was wedged between the tracks and the only way for the cab car to go was up."
</S>
<S s_id="82">
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</S>
<S s_id="83">
He said that Metrolink is involved in three to five grade crossing accidents a year, some involving attempted or successful suicides.
</S>
<S s_id="84">
"If someone wants to commit suicide," Solow said, "I don't care if it's on a highway, a railroad or jumping off a bridge, none of us is going to stop that.
</S>
<S s_id="85">
It's one of the banes of our existence."
