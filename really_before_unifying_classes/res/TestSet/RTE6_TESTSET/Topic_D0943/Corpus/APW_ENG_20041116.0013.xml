Prosecutor says defendant in Air India bombings that killed 331 had
history of inciting Sikhs
</S>

Two fiery speeches delivered to Sikh groups in the early 1980s show Ajaib Singh Bagri had a motive to plant bombs on Air India jets killing 331 people, a prosecutor said in closing arguments Monday.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Bagri, a 55-year-old mill worker in Kamloops, British Columbia, and Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act before the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.

Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
Prosecutor Richard Cairns argued that Bargris was a high-ranking member of a terrorist group.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
"Revenge, revenge, revenge.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
That's what he wants."
</S>
<S s_id="8">
Cairns said Bagri gave two speeches calling for retribution for the 1984 raids on India's Golden Temple, Sikhisms holiest shrine.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Cairns also said Bagri made pointed references to Air India, saying the Indian government used proceeds from the airline to purchase weapons to use against Sikhs.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
"Bagri is exhorting the crowd to take revenge on the Indian government and Hindus," Cairns said.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
He said that in the speech, Bagri "identifies his targets and he advocates revenge."
</S>
<S s_id="12">
The defense has argued that Bagri's speeches amount only to fiery oratory, and has questioned the credibility of witnesses in the case, including that the star witness against Bagri, who was paid to testify by Canadian authorities.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
That witness, a member of a militant Sikh group whose identity is protected by the court, said Bagri told him that he was responsible for the bombings.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Bagri allegedly made the comment following a speech he gave at New York's Madison Square Gardens.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
"'We have stuff that can blow like, like a (city) block," Cairns said, repeating the witnesses' testimony of what Bagri told him.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
The witness, who is not charged with a crime, was paid US$386,000 (euro298,000) to testify.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Cairns also noted that another protected witness testified that Bagri asked her if he could borrow her car to take some bags to Vancouver International Airport.
</S>
<S s_id="18">
The bags would be going on the plane, he would not, the woman testified.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
A verdict in the trial which began in April 2003 isn't expected until early 2005.
