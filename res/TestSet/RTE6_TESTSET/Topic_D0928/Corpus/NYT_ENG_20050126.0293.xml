PROSECUTORS REWRITE SCRIPT IN TRIAL OF EX-TYCO OFFICIALS
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Prosecutors rewrote their opening script for the retrial of L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz on Wednesday, purging the most striking accusations of lavish spending that they had concentrated on during the first trial.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Instead, prosecutors focused on laying out the core theme of their case, saying the two men, former Tyco executives, had illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
"This case is the story of how two men -- the defendants in this case -- stole $150 million from a company named Tyco and that corporation's owners, its shareholders," said Owen Heimer, an assistant Manhattan district attorney, in his opening statement in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
"These defendants ran Tyco, but they did not own Tyco."
</S>
<S s_id="5">
While the case against Kozlowski and Swartz is very similar to the first trial, the prosecution's new strategy -- conceived after hours of interviews with jurors from the previous trial who criticized their approach as unfocused -- may mean this trial could take on a markedly different tone.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
The prosecution needed no reminder of that trial.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
The lessons it had learned were already on display: Heimer, a veteran, was added to the prosecution's team and took the lead in opening arguments, while Kenneth Chalifoux, an assistant Manhattan district attorney who presented a meandering and often confusing opening during the first trial, looked on from the prosecution's table.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
Lawyers for Kozlowski and Swartz are scheduled to present their opening arguments on Thursday.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
Heimer spent much of his presentation arguing that Kozlowski and Swartz had intended to commit a crime.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
In the last trial, at least one juror said she had been prepared to acquit on all charges because she could not find that the men had the requisite criminal intent.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
Many other jurors said they, too, had wrestled with the issue of criminal intent.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
Heimer repeatedly spoke to the jury of a process he described as "instruct, deceive and conceal."
</S>
<S s_id="13">
He said he would show evidence that the men had instructed their subordinates to forgive loans, deceived the subordinates by telling them the bonuses had been approved by the board and then had concealed the payments from the board and the public by not disclosing them.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Heimer said the men had also paid their subordinates unapproved bonuses "because they were buying the employees' loyalty and buying the employees' silence."
