Irish PM admits to private meetings with Sinn Fein leader
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern admitted on Tuesday that he had held a series of private one-on-one meetings on the Northern Ireland peace process with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, but denied they had been secret in any way.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Answering questions in parliament, Ahern told MPs that the meetings with Adams, whose party is the political wing of the IRA, Northern Ireland's main Catholic paramilitary group, had merely been to maintain dialogue.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
He said there had been "possibly three or four meetings" with Adams since March.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
"On balance, these meetings at this particular time were better conducted outside the glare of publicity," Ahern said.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
In April, Adams appealed to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to end violence and fully embrace democratic means.

Ahern said he explained to Adams the clear position required by the Irish government before negotiations could resume on restoring the power-sharing political institutions in British-ruled Northern Ireland.
</S>

These included a total end to IRA paramilitarism and related criminality and full decommissioning of the IRA's arms and explosives arsenals.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
"It is only on that basis that we can move forward," Ahern said.
</S>

Ahern is to meet his British counterpart Tony Blair in London on Wednesday.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
He will also be holding talks with Ian Paisley, leader of Northern Ireland's biggest Protestant political group, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
</S>
<S s_id="11">
Ahern stressed to MPs that Northern Ireland was entering the summer season of Protestant loyalist Orange Order marches, that traditionally cause tensions between Catholics and Protestants.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will, by the end of this month, announce a plan for a complete and swift process of disarmament.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
A deal on the so-called "decommissioning" of IRA weapons was almost reached at the end of last year, but foundered on demands from the DUP that the process by verified through photographs.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Northern Ireland has seen a virtual end to more than 30 years of violence since the landmark 1998 Good Friday peace deal, but Dublin and London, as well as an independent monitoring body, have accused paramilitary groups of continued criminal activities.
