White House adviser asks for honest debate over anti-terror Patriot Act
</S>
<S s_id="1">
The White House's homeland security adviser asked attorneys Thursday to help foster an honest debate over whether to reauthorize controversial anti-terror laws.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Fran Townsend said White House support for extending the entire USA Patriot Act, which expires at the end of the year, is "unequivocal."
</S>
<S s_id="3">
That law, which was passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, gives the government broad surveillance and law enforcement powers in terror cases.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
"In the debate over the Patriot Act, we often hear about that delicate balance that we rightly must make between freedom and security," Townsend told the American Bar Association.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
"I value that debate.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
The president values that debate.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
And it is important.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
What is equally important is that we not permit this valuable tool to be caught up in unnecessary rhetoric."
</S>
<S s_id="9">
"I encourage you to keep that debate honest," Townsend said.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
"...We really should try to divorce this from partisan politics."
</S>
<S s_id="11">
Civil liberties groups and privacy advocates have lambasted the Patriot Act because they believe it undermines freedom.
</S>
<S s_id="12">
Critics says among the law's more controversial powers is the FBI's ability to obtain library and bookstore records in terrorism cases, and so-called "sneak and peek" search warrants in which agents need not immediately tell suspects their home or business had been searched.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
Townsend said she said she recently asked an audience to indicate how many people were concerned about the "library records provision" in the act.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
"Probably 70 percent of hands went up," Townsend said.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
"And people were really stunned that there is nowhere in the Patriot Act the mention of library records."
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Section 215 of the Patriot Act does not specifically mention bookstores or libraries, but permits secret warrants for "books, records, papers, documents and other items" from businesses, hospitals or other organizations.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
Congress has rejected attempts to bar the FBI from using Patriot Act authority to obtain library and bookstore records.
