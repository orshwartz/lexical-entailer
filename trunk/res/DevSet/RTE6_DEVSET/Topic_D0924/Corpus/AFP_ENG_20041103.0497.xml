Merck's Vioxx may have led to 27,785 heart attacks: FDA study
</S>
<S s_id="1">
A study sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration estimates that Merck painkiller Vioxx, withdrawn from the market in September, could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since it was approved in 1999.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
The study concluded that Vioxx, known under the chemical name rofecoxib, "increases the risk of serious coronary heart disease defined as acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death," the FDA study concluded.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
A high dose increased risk by 3.7-fold and standard-dose by 1.5-fold compared to a rival drug produced by Pfizer, Celebrex, or celecoxib, the FDA said.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
The study, published Tuesday, also suggested Merck tried to explain away signs that showed Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, in company-sponsored clinical trials four years ago.

Merck had argued that a comparison between Vioxx and a generic anti-inflammatory drug called naproxen was misleading because the latter could help protect against heart attacks or strokes.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
However, the FDA study disputed that, saying naproxen showed "no protective effect" against heart attacks.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
"The manufacturer attributed this difference to a never-before recognized protective effect of Naproxen," said the study.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
"To explain a five-fold difference, Naproxen would have had to be one of the most potent and effective cardio-protectants known."
</S>
<S s_id="9">
On Tuesday the company described the FDA estimates as speculation: "In general, there is no reliable way to measure the actual use in the population and therefore no reliable way to estimate the actual number of events."
</S>
<S s_id="10">
Merck pulled the 2.5 billion dollar-a-year-seller Vioxx off the market on September 30 when an internal study found it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke after 18 months of continuous use.
