JENNINGS HAS LUNG CANCER, PLANS TO KEEP ANCHOR POST
</S>
<S s_id="1">
Peter Jennings, the last of the three major anchors of his era who is still working on a nightly newscast, revealed Tuesday that he has lung cancer and that he will begin chemotherapy next week.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
E-mail messages released Tuesday by Jennings and ABC News president David Westin stressed that Jennings, who is 66 and who has anchored ABC's "World News Tonight" since 1983, will continue to work during treatment, provided he feels well enough.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
Jennings decided late Tuesday not to anchor Tuesday night's program and was replaced by "20/20" coanchor Elizabeth Vargas.
</S>

The dramatic news - which comes on the heels of last week's announcement that "Nightline" host Ted Koppel will leave at year's end and which follows the recent departures of CBS and NBC anchors Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw - reinforces the idea that a chapter in television journalism is coming to an end.
</S>

"Your initial reaction is you wish Peter Jennings well," said J.Max Robins, editor in chief at Broadcasting &amp; Cable magazine.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
"You really wonder, if given this kind of narrowcasting environment, we'll ever see people of this iconic stature again in the news business."
</S>
<S s_id="7">
The health of Jennings, a former smoker, surfaced as an issue late last year, when he was unable to travel abroad for coverage of the devastating tsunami in southern and Southeast Asia.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
At the time, ABC insiders thought he was battling a lingering flu or a similar ailment.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
The announcement Tuesday seemed to stun the network.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
"Obviously this is a very emotional day at ABC News," said a spokesman, Jeffrey Schneider.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
"Everybody is rallying around Peter, and we are here to help him get through this and beat this."
</S>
<S s_id="12">
He added: "We expect him to be the anchor for many years to come."
</S>
<S s_id="13">
NBC completed a lengthy and smoothly choreographed transition in December when Brian Williams succeeded Brokaw in the anchor chair.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
At CBS, Rather's announcement last November that he would step down, which followed a furor over the flawed "60 Minutes Wednesday" report on President Bush's military record, left that network scrambling for a successor.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Veteran correspondent Bob Schieffer was picked to fill the slot on an interim basis when Rather departed last month.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
ABC's "World News Tonight" is currently in second place in the nightly news wars, but it has been breathing down the neck of the ratings leader, "NBC Nightly News."
</S>
<S s_id="17">
(For the week that ended April 1, ABC's newscast averaged almost 9.5 million viewers, compared with 10 million for NBC.)
</S>
<S s_id="18">
Until now, there has not been much public discussion about an eventual successor to Jennings, who has worked at ABC News since 1964.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
Schneider said the diagnosis has not caused the network to focus more intently on the Jennings succession.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
In his e-mail to the staff, Westin said that when Jennings is unable to work, Vargas and "Good Morning America" cohost Charles Gibson would be among the substitutes.
</S>
<S s_id="21">
Others likely to fill in include chief White House correspondent Terry Moran and network correspondent Bob Woodruff.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
While making Jennings's condition public, the network did not provide details about the diagnosis or prognosis.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
Westin wrote that the anchor would undergo outpatient treatment in New York and that "we should also expect him to be off the broadcast from time to time."
</S>
<S s_id="24">
In his own e-mail to his colleagues, Jennings said: "There will be good days and bad, which means that some days I may be cranky and some days really cranky!
</S>
<S s_id="25">
"Almost 10 million Americans are living with cancer.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
I am sure I will learn from them how to cope with the facts of life that none of us anticipated."
</S>
<S s_id="27">
Dr. Scott Swanson, a thoracic surgeon at New York's Mount Sinai Medical Center who specializes in lung cancer, said of Jennings: "He seems pretty healthy now.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
In terms of the chemotherapy stopping him, most people do work through chemotherapy."
</S>
<S s_id="29">
"Lung cancer in general is aggressive," Swanson added.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
"Overall, we're still having a hard time with it, mainly because we're not finding it in an early phase."
