Canadian prosecutor says revenge drove 1985 Air India bombings that
killed 331
</S>
<S s_id="1">
One of two men accused in the 1985 Air India bombings that claimed 331 lives was driven by ambition and revenge, a prosecutor told a Canadian court in his closing arguments Monday.
</S>
<S s_id="2">
Vancouver millionaire Ripudaman Singh Malik, 57, and Kamloops, British Columbia, mill worker Ajaib Singh Bagri, 55, are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and first degree murder in the world's worst airline terrorism act prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
</S>
<S s_id="3">
Air India Flight 182, a Boeing 747 on its way from Toronto to India via London, blew up off the Irish coast on June 23, 1985, killing all aboard.
</S>
<S s_id="4">
A second bomb exploded at Tokyo's Narita Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
</S>
<S s_id="5">
"It has been shown (Malik) has a powerful and pervasive motive," prosecutor Joe Bellows said in British Columbia Supreme Court.
</S>
<S s_id="6">
He told Judge Ian Josephson that the Indian government's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Sikhism's holiest shrine, was a pivotal event in Malik's desire for revenge.
</S>
<S s_id="7">
Hundreds died in the attack.
</S>
<S s_id="8">
"All Sikhs . . . felt a terrible sacrilege had been committed against their religion," Bellows said.
</S>
<S s_id="9">
"They ignited in Malik emotions of both ambition and revenge," he said.
</S>
<S s_id="10">
"Malik and his co-conspirators chose to destroy not one but two Air India planes.
</S>
<S s_id="11">
The message to be conveyed was: If we can do this, we can do anything."
</S>
<S s_id="12">
Bellows said the 1984 assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards was also part of the reaction to the temple raid.
</S>
<S s_id="13">
As Bellows spoke, Malik, dressed in traditional Sikh garb, dozed in the prisoners' box protected by bulletproof glass.
</S>
<S s_id="14">
Bellows said Malik's praise for convicted bomb-maker Inderjit Singh Reyat and his financial support for Reyat's family while in prison is further proof of his involvement in the plot.
</S>
<S s_id="15">
Bellows said Malik wanted to teach the Indian government a lesson as Sikhs fought for the creation of an independent Sikh homeland, Khalistan, in India's Punjab state.
</S>
<S s_id="16">
Bellows recounted the testimony of one man who said Malik had approached him to carry an attache case containing a time bomb to Vancouver's airport.
</S>
<S s_id="17">
"If a child dies for Sikhism, so what?"
</S>
<S s_id="18">
Bellows recalled, quoting from the witness' testimony of what Malik told him.
</S>
<S s_id="19">
"To Malik, the death of a child means nothing, the death of 329 people means nothing.
</S>
<S s_id="20">
What matters is Khalistan."
</S>
<S s_id="21">
The witness, whose name is protected by a court ordered publication ban, said Malik had been asked to approach him for the task by Talwinder Singh Parmar, the suspected mastermind behind the plot and a leader of the extremist Babbar Khalsa Sikh separatist group.
</S>
<S s_id="22">
Parmar died in a shootout with Indian police in 1992.
</S>
<S s_id="23">
Bellows showed the court a Canadian intelligence photograph of Malik outside Parmar's home five days before the bombings.
</S>
<S s_id="24">
The defense has tried to discredit Malik's alleged confession of his involvement in the bombings to an intimate female friend whose name is also protected by the court.
</S>
<S s_id="25">
She was a disgruntled former employee motivated by revenge, defense lawyers argued.
</S>
<S s_id="26">
Bellows, however, said the Crown witness was highly credible and that the case against Malik "is proven on her evidence alone."
</S>
<S s_id="27">
The woman, who testified that she had a close personal relationship with Malik, wrote in her diary that he had said: "We had Air India crash.
</S>
<S s_id="28">
Nobody, nobody can do anything."
</S>
<S s_id="29">
Malik and Bagri, who have been in custody since their arrest in late 2000, are also charged with the Narita blast.
</S>
<S s_id="30">
Bellows was expected to continue his closing arguments on Tuesday, and the case is likely to go to the judge for a verdict in mid-December.
</S>
<S s_id="31">
The defense concluded its case last month.
</S>
<S s_id="32">
Malik's legal team said their client is innocent and accused the witnesses against him of being motivated by a desire for revenge.
</S>
<S s_id="33">
The case has stretched for 13 months since hearings began in April 2003.
</S>
<S s_id="34">
More than 32 lawyers are working on the case, which is believed to have cost more than $US80 million (euro62 million).
